Contributing to Kos development
===============================

There are several ways in which you can contribute to Kos development:

* Use Kos and report bugs or enhancement proposals.
* Help with fixing existing bugs.
* Create and submit new Kos modules.
* Submit any enhancements that you made.


Reporting bugs and enhancements proposals
=========================================

Please use GitHub Issues to report bugs and enhancements proposals.

When reporting bugs, in most cases please provide a minimal example code which
reproduces the bug.  This helps diagnosing the issue quickly.


Submitting changes
==================

Every change, whether a bug fix or an enhancement, must be accompanied with
tests.  For bug fixes, a test must be provided, which catches the original
bug and passes after the fix is applied.  Every change must pass all existing
tests on all platforms and 100% test coverage is required for every line of
code.

Please submit changes in the form of Pull Requests on GitHub.
