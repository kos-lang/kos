Introduction
------------

To ensure that Kos is as much useful as possible, it is distributed on the
MIT license.  This means that you can integrate Kos with your project
regardless of whether your project is open source or closed source.

However, it is recommended that you share any modifications you make to Kos
core or modules with the community.  This will benefit everyone, including
you.  This way you will be able to easily integrate future updates from
upstream with your project.  Please see [Contributing](doc/contributing.md)
for further details on how you can contribute.
